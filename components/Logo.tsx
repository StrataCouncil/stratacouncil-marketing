/**
 * StrataCouncil.ca / Stratasphere mark.
 *
 * Rendered inline (not via <img src>) so it takes its color from CSS
 * `color` on this element or an ancestor, like every other color in the
 * design system. An <img>-referenced SVG can't inherit `currentColor` from
 * the page, which is why this is a component rather than a static file.
 *
 * The viewBox is cropped to the mark itself, so its box is the mark's
 * size. Beside the wordmark it's 1.51em tall with a 0.33em gap (the brand
 * lockup: the wordmark's capitals are 47% of the mark's height, the gap a
 * quarter of it). Same as the app's.
